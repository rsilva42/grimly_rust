# Grimly (in Rust)

Grimly is a maze solver.

I am writing it as my first Rust project because of the learning opportunities its specifications presents in parsing, algorithms, and program design while staying manageable enough to focus on the syntax of a new language rather than on solving an overwhelming problem.

## Installation & Usage

This project is built with cargo:
```bash
cargo build --release
./grimly file.map [file2.map ...]
```
The program can take multiple files at a time printing the solution for each before iterating to the next file.

## What are `.map` files?

The program supports `.map` files which have a header followed by the actual map.

The header is the first line of the file which has the dimensions of the map and the characters used in the following order: height (end denoted by an 'x'), width, wall character, empty character, path character, start character, end character.

For example, "`10x10* o12`" denotes a `10` by `10` grid where walls are `*`, empty spaces are `' '`, and the solution must be denoted with `o` starting from `1` and ending at `2`.

After the header is the map section which is the actual maze to be solved.

Full map file:
```
10x10* o12
**1*******
**  *    *
*    *  **
* *     **
* *     **
*        *
*  *   * *
**       *
**  *    *
******2***

```

Maps can be created with the included ruby file `maze_gen.rb`:
```bash
./maze_gen.rb height width characters
```
Making a 10 by 10 maze:
```bash
./maze_gen.rb 10 10 "* o12"
```

Additional rules as specified in [Grimly Instructions.pdf](https://github.com/rsilva42/grimly_rust/blob/master/Grimly%20Instructions.pdf) page 5 (adjusted for consistency):

* All lines must respect the sizes given in the first line (HeightxWidth).
* There can only be one start.
* There must be at least one end.
* There must be a solution to the maze.
* The maze will not be more than a billion squared.
* At the end of each line, there is a new line.
* The characters present in the maze must only be those shown in the first line.
* If there is an invalid maze, there must be an error message and then proceed to the next maze if any.


## Project specifications
The project is built to the specifications of the [Grimly Instructions.pdf](https://github.com/rsilva42/grimly_rust/blob/master/Grimly%20Instructions.pdf) document. I took some liberties with the rules to adjust them to Rust (originally in C).
